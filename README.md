# Production-Line
This project contains the files for creating a 2-DOF cartesian robot integrated with a handling subsystem .i.e 2 conveyors and has feeding, assembly and disassembly units that control the conveyors. The communication protocol used is i2c between the handling and all the subsystems, except the 2-DOF robot it done using a CAN Bus.
